	<h1 style="color:orange">Our History</h1>
	<img class="aboutphoto" src="founderphoto.jpg" alt ="Owner and Founder: Samuel Perez Lopez" width="100" height="100">
	<p> ResWin Studios stemmed from the combination of skills acuired by our founder Samuel Perez Lopez. As a student at Eastern Connecticut State University, he partook in multiple classes which allowed him to develop these skills, which he then chose to implinet into the creation of ResWin Studios. Originally, a begining stage concept for a publishing company, Samuel later amended this to incorporate the knowledge he obtained within his communication minor. Taking his background and challenges into account, the idea from the name came from the shortening of the word Resilient (a word he has been told on multiple occasion) and the Word Wing, which he felt symbolized the challenges within his life as it stood as a reminded of the Monarch Butterfly's wing- a symbol of migration within the immigrant community. </p><hr>
